# Entropy-Learning-Atonal
This project investigates the effect of formal learning about serial music on expectation and uncertainty in this style. BMus students will rate surprise (expectation/prediction), uncertainty (precision) and closure for 8 serial music phrases twice: before studying serial music as part of their degree programme and after studying serial music.  https://osf.io/kqzg8/
